Unit 4 : Master pages, theme caching, application pages & Data

1. Master page :
Master pages allow you to create a consistent look and behavior
 for all the pages (or group of pages) in your web application.
Extensio : .master

2. Skin 
A skin is a definition of styles applied to server controls in your ASP.NET page

3. Caching
Caching is a technique of storing frequently used data/information in memory, 
so that, when the same data/information is needed next time, 
it could be directly retrieved from the memory instead of 
being generated by the application. 

ASP.NET supports three types of caching:
- Page Output Caching [Output caching]
- Page Fragment Caching [Output caching]
- Data Caching
